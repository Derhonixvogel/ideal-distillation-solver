# Ideal distillation

For the process of coding this peace of software first it was necessary to
review my knowledge in unit operations such as distillation. I first start with
the ideal flash distillation which consists in a simple vessel with one inlets
and two outlets, one at the top for the vapor phase and other at the bottom of
the column for the liquid. The equipment receive and return _Streams_ objects
which contain _substance_ objects within. Each one of this _substance_ represent
real components of a current, such a water or alcohol.
