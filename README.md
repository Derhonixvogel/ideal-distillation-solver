# Simple Flash Tank (Distillation)

Flash Tanks are widely use in the industry to separate two-phase flow streams
allowing both the vapor and the liquid continuing the process according to
specific conditions for better performance or considering safety reasons. Some
of the motives a flash tank is use for are within but not limited to the
follow list.

* Reduce pressure steam
* Allow condensate
* Purge a stream for bubbles
* Basic separation previously a multistage distillation

Rigorously talking, calculation of flash distillations are obtained using
advanced modeling software and implementing well know mathematical models along
with state of art experimental data. However, roughs calculation such as those
made with ideal models and public domain values of some substances, is also
important as a tool of fast decision making. Also this approach can help to
understand the operation in an academical way.
